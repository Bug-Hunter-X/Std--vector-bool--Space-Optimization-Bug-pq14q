This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug associated with using std::vector<bool> in C++.  std::vector<bool> is notorious for its non-standard implementation, deviating from the standard container behavior. This can lead to unexpected behavior when copying or modifying the vector, potentially causing memory corruption or other unpredictable issues. The bug example and its solution are provided to illustrate the problem and recommend a safe alternative.
